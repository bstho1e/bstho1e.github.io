Surprisingly, installing Ubuntu 13.04 on a MacbookPro10,2, almost everything seemed to work out of the box. But after upgrading to 13.10, there was a one major flaw which is *very* annoying if not fixed. Wifi connection seemed to be dropping a lot of packets. For me it was at most 50% packet loss. The issue seems to be with Broadcomâ€™s proprietary drivers. Apparently the previous version of Ubuntu shipped with an older version of the driver which seemed to work fine.

The solution is to downgrade the Broadcom driver. I followed instructions posted in [this blog post](https://nick.groenen.me/posts/2013/11/09/fixing-the-broadcom-bcm4331-wireless-drivers-on-ubuntu-1310/ "Nick Groenen's blog"). It covers how to successfully downgrade the driver and make sure no future update is applied to it.

There's also a bug reported on [Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/bcmwl/+bug/1289857 "link to bug report on launchpad").

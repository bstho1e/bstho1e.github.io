This is kinda cool. Let's say you need to access your work computer from your home. You have a small office with no dedicated IT support. Probably you don't have a VPN which you could use to connect to your work network. But you have a spare Raspberry Pi lying around. You could put that into use and create a connection to your work machine by creating a reverse SSH proxy.

What you're going to need:
* a working Raspberry Pi
* physical access to your work network
* a server outside of your work network

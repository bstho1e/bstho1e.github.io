A few years ago I [wrote about how breaks work magic on your brain]({{site.url}}/articles/programming-tips-and-tricks-%231/ "Link to a post I wrote a few years ago about taking a break"). This is a continuation of this post where I go into the topic a bit more deeply.

Last time I wrote about a specific example on how spending several hours on a particular task (finding a solution to a bug in my case) and not getting anywhere can be frustrating. The solution I gave was to take a break, work on something else or work on finding the bug the next morning when your brain has had time to rest. For me it has worked well and in hindsight I am amazed how I was able to spend so many hours on an easy problem.

Taking a break can boost your creativity and you can see something you could not when you were tired. At least for me it has worked that way. Surprisingly this has been studied as well.

>People are more successful if we force them to move away from a problem or distract them temporarily

[Creativity of the Mind](http://www.wired.com/2010/02/st_essay_distraction/ "Wired article mentioning the book") is a book about psychology and neuroscience of creativity. They found that regular breaks boost problem-solving skills, partly by making it easier to go through memories in search of relevant clues.

What about longer beaks? No, I'm not talking about taking a vacation, although I would not turn one down. What about taking a sabbatical? Stefan Sagmeister is a graphic designer and in his [TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_time_off "The power of time off - a TED talk by Stefan Sagmeister") he points out the importance of taking an extended break. Every 7 years he closes his design studio for a whole year to experiment on new things.

[Dropwizard](http://www.dropwizard.io) is a framework for building [RESTful](https://www.sitepoint.com/what-does-restful-really-mean/) web services in Java. Similar to [Spring Boot](), Dropwizard applications are packaged into an executable *fat* JAR file. All external libraries your application depends on are present in a single file. The same artifact can be promoted from test to staging to production while being sure thereâ€™s no version changes in libraries used.

To execute a Dropwizard application, its `main` method needs to be called with the correct arguments. When you execute a JAR file from the command line, the JVM reads the entry point to your application from the `MANIFEST.MF` file. It contains name-value pairs and the key we're interested in is `Main-Class`. In a Dropwizard application, this is set to your `Applicaiton` class.

Equipped with this knowledge, it should be relatively easy to instruct your IDE to run a Dropwizard application during development.

## IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open *Run/Debug Configuration* menu by selecting Run -> Edit Configurations... from the menu.
2. Add a new configuration by pressing Alt+Insert or clicking the green plus sign in the top left corner.
3. From the dropdown menu, select *Application*.
4. Add a name to the configuration.
5. Enter the fully qualified name of your main class.
6. Enter `server config.yml` to the *Program arguments* field. These are the same arguments you would pass to your application if you were running it from the command line.

I was unable to connect to QlikView Access Point from a Linux machine. My browser presented me with a username/password prompt and after entering the correct credentials no autentication was made it seemded. At first I thought the web server has been misconfigured. After testing I found that using a Windows computer the authentication worked flawlessy. Later I heard that clients were unable to connect with their OS X coputers.

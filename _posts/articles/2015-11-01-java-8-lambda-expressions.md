In computer programming, an anonymous function (also function literal or lambda abstraction) is a function definition that is not bound to an identifier ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function "Anonymous function")). Many modern programming languages have have had them for a long time. It's only Java that's a little late to the party. While being 20 years old, it has received lambda expressions relatively recently.

Before Java 8, Java developers could use anonymous inner classes to achieve something similar to lambda expressions. [In my last post]({{site.url}}/articles/java-8-behavior-parameterization "Java 8: Behavior parameterization") I showed that this is verbose and discourages the use of passing code as a parameter.
